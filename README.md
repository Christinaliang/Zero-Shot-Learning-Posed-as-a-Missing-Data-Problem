# Zero-Shot Learning Posed as a Missing Data Problem

This is the code of the method 'MDP' in paper 'Zero-Shot Learning Posed as a Missing Data Problem'.

## Data Download
	You can download all data (image features, attribtues and word vectors of AwA and CUB) used in this paper 
	from [google drive](https://drive.google.com/open?id=18YYOi5FxiBJ5TYLfOkzO3HGw_w-EveyY). 
	Then, put the data and code in the same fold (root path of the project).

## Run the Code
	Before running the code, you need to upzip SLEP_package_4.1.zip. 
	This package is for the function 'LeastR'. 
	For more support, you can visit the [website](http://www.yelab.net/software/SLEP/). 
	Finally, you can run ICCVW_EXP_AwA.m and ICCVW_EXP_CUB.m .
